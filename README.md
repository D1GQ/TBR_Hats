## Hat Creation  

A hat consists of multiple textures. The recommended texture resolution is **300px x 375px** with a **4:5 aspect ratio**.  

### Required Textures  
1. **Main Texture** (`sprite`):  
   - The primary texture of your hat.  
   - Rendered in front of the player.
   - File name pattern: `hatname.png`.  
   - Optional Parameters in the configuration:  
     - `bounce`: Makes the hat bounce when the player moves.  
     - `colorbase`: Uses the playerâ€™s color shader (e.g., red (#ff0000) is replaced with the playerâ€™s primary color, blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color).  
     - `behind`: Renders the hat behind the player.  

2. **Climbing Texture** (`climbsprite`):  
   - Used when the player climbs a ladder.  
   - File name pattern: `hatname_climb.png`.

### Optional Textures  
1. **Back Texture** (`backsprite`):  
   - Renders behind the player.  
   - File name pattern: `hatname_back.png`.  

2. **Flipped Texture** (`flipsprite`):  
   - Used when the player faces left.  
   - File name pattern: `hatname_flip.png`.  

3. **Flipped Back Texture** (`flipbacksprite`):  
   - Back texture for when the player faces left.  
   - File name pattern: `hatname_flipback.png`.
